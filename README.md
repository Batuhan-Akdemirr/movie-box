# movie-box
I developed a movie search application called Movie Box with a simple interface using the TMDB API. Movie Box is an
application that displays upcoming and popular movies worldwide, allows users to search for films and view their details,
and lists movies similar to those viewed by the user. The application has Turkish-English language support.
